TASK 1 : Data Exploration and Summary

🎯Objective: Understand and summarize key statistics in the dataset

Steps that I followed:
1. Data Import: I started by importing the dataset into Power BI. 
2. Exploratory Analysis: Once the dataset was imported, I began exploring its structure and the types of data it contained. This initial exploration helped me understand the dataset.
3. Calculate Statistics: I calculated several key statistics. First, I computed the average age of individuals in the dataset to understand the demographic profile. Then, I determined the percentage of individuals who had invested in various types of Avenues. Additionally, I identified common savings objectives that appeared frequently in the dataset.
4. Visualization: To effectively communicate the insights gained from the dataset, I created a variety of charts and graphs.
